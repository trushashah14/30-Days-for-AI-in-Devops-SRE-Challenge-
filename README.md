# 30 Days of AI in DevOps/SRE ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

Welcome to my **30 Days of AI in DevOps/SRE Challenge**!  
This repository documents my journey to explore and apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) within the realms of DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).

---

## Why am I taking this challenge?

As a DevOps/SRE engineer, I believe AI and ML are revolutionizing how we build, monitor, automate, and secure modern systems. While AI is rapidly becoming a key differentiator in tech, my experience so far has been mostly in traditional DevOps/SRE practices.  
**Iâ€™m a complete beginner in AI/ML.**  
This challenge is my way to learn AI from scratch, understand its practical uses in operations, and showcase how these technologies can enhance reliability, scalability, and automation.

## How will this challenge help me?

- **Learn AI/ML hands-on:** Every day, Iâ€™ll tackle a practical problem that combines AI/ML with DevOps/SRE tasks.
- **Build an AI portfolio:** By documenting code, experiments, and insights, Iâ€™ll have tangible proof of my learning and growth.
- **Interview readiness:** The challenges are designed to prepare me for real-world technical interviews, especially those asking about AI in ops.
- **Stay future-ready:** AI-powered operations (AIOps) are the futureâ€”this challenge helps me stay ahead of the curve.

---

## Whatâ€™s in this repo?

- **Daily Challenges:** Each day features a new task that uses AI/ML to solve DevOps/SRE problemsâ€”think anomaly detection, predictive scaling, automated incident response, log analysis, and more.
- **Solutions & Documentation:** Youâ€™ll find code, notebooks, diagrams, and write-ups for each challenge.
- **Reflections:** Iâ€™ll share lessons learned, struggles, and breakthroughs as I go.
- **Resources:** Links to tutorials, docs, and open-source tools I use.
