# Payment Processing Incident - Business Impact Focus

## Summary
At 08:12 UTC on October 15, 2023, a high memory usage alert was triggered on api-server-03, indicating potential performance issues. Subsequent database queries took longer than expected, resulting in connection timeouts and failed payment transactions. The incident escalated to multiple failed customer payment attempts reported by frontend services, leading to initiating failover to the replica server. Payment processing was restored with limited capacity at 08:20 UTC, and the database primary server responded again after restarting at 08:25 UTC. The incident was resolved at 08:30 UTC when all systems were operational, and payment processing capacity was fully restored.
