# Day 3: LLM-Generated Incident Summary

## Overview

This project leverages Ollama's local LLM capabilities to automatically generate professional incident summaries from raw system logs. Instead of manually analyzing logs during incidents, this tool extracts key information, timelines, and affected systems to create concise, well-structured incident reports suitable for status pages.

The solution uses local LLM processing, keeping sensitive log data private while eliminating API costs. Various models are supported, allowing flexibility based on your specific needs and available computing resources.

## Workflow

1. **Log Collection**: Gather relevant logs from your monitoring systems in JSON format
2. **Automated Analysis**: The tool processes logs through the LLM to identify key events and patterns
3. **Summary Generation**: A professional incident summary is created with standardized formatting:
   - Clear incident title
   - Concise description of impact
   - Timeline of key events
   - List of affected systems
   - Current status and next steps
4. **Human Review**: Review and refine the generated summary before publication
5. **Status Page Publication**: Publish the vetted summary to your public status page

## Conclusion

This solution dramatically reduces the time required to create professional incident summaries from 15-30 minutes to under 1 minute. By automating the initial analysis and draft creation, it allows incident responders to focus on resolution rather than communication overhead.

Key benefits include:
- Consistent, professional incident communications
- Significant time savings during critical incidents
- Complete privacy with local processing
- No ongoing API costs
- Customizable to match your organization's communication style

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Log Integration**: Connect directly to log aggregation systems like ELK/Splunk
2. **Automated Status Updates**: Generate follow-up summaries as incidents progress
3. **Custom Templates**: Allow organizations to define specific summary formats
4. **Impact Assessment**: Add automatic severity classification and business impact analysis
5. **Multi-model Pipeline**: Use specialized models for different aspects of log analysis
6. **Historical Learning**: Improve summaries based on feedback from past incidents
7. **Status Page API Integration**: Direct publishing to status page platforms
8. **Multi-language Support**: Generate summaries in multiple languages for global operations
