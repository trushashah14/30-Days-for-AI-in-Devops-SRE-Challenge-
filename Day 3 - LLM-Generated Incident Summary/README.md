# Day 3: LLM-Generated Incident Summary 📝 - Aug 10, 2025

## Overview 🔍

This project leverages Ollama's local LLM capabilities to automatically generate professional incident summaries from raw system logs. Instead of manually analyzing logs during incidents, this tool extracts key information, timelines, and affected systems to create concise, well-structured incident reports suitable for status pages.

The solution uses local LLM processing, keeping sensitive log data private while eliminating API costs. Various models are supported, allowing flexibility based on your specific needs and available computing resources.

## 💻 Code & Implementation
- [incident_summarizer.py](./incident_summarizer.py) - Main Python script for incident summary generation
- [Step-by-Step-Solution.md](./Step-by-Step-Solution.md) - Detailed implementation process
- [logs/](./logs/) - Sample log files used for testing


## Workflow 🔄

1. **Log Collection**: Gather relevant logs from your monitoring systems in JSON format
2. **Automated Analysis**: The tool processes logs through the LLM to identify key events and patterns
3. **Summary Generation**: A professional incident summary is created with standardized formatting:
   - Clear incident title
   - Concise description of impact
   - Timeline of key events
   - List of affected systems
   - Current status and next steps
4. **Human Review**: Review and refine the generated summary before publication
5. **Status Page Publication**: Publish the vetted summary to your public status page




## What Did I Learn 🧠
- **Log Analysis Automation**: Transforming raw logs into meaningful narratives requires careful prompt design and contextual understanding
- **Prompt Engineering Techniques**: Structuring prompts with clear sections and instructions significantly improves LLM output quality
- **Model Comparison**: Different LLM models excel at different aspects of log analysis and summary generation
- **Local LLM Deployment**: Running models locally with Ollama provides significant privacy benefits and eliminates API costs
- **Structured Output Generation**: Guiding LLMs to produce consistently formatted summaries requires clear templates and examples
- **Context Window Optimization**: Managing input size and prioritizing relevant log entries improves summary quality
- **Human-in-the-Loop Design**: Creating systems that generate draft summaries for human review combines AI efficiency with human judgment
- **Incident Communication Best Practices**: Effective incident summaries follow consistent patterns focusing on impact, timeline, and status

## Real-World Applications 🌍

### Automated Incident Summary Generation 📝
**Use Case**: **Status Page Communication**
- **Implementation**: Automatically generate incident summaries from logs using LLMs, reducing manual analysis and drafting time.
- **Advantage**: Ensures consistent, professional communication during outages and incidents.
- **Industry Example**: SaaS and cloud providers publishing incident summaries to status pages in minutes.
- **DevOps Integration**: Connects with log aggregation tools and status page APIs for seamless workflow.

### Human-in-the-Loop Review & Publication 👩‍💻
**Use Case**: **Quality Assurance**
- **Implementation**: AI generates draft summaries for human review and refinement before publication.
- **Advantage**: Combines AI speed with human judgment for high-quality incident communication.
- **Industry Example**: E-commerce and fintech teams reviewing AI-generated summaries before posting to customers.
- **Production Integration**: Automated summary generation followed by manual approval workflow.

## Where Was AI Used? 🤖

- **AI Used:**  
  Local LLM (Ollama, e.g. Llama2) was used to automatically generate incident summaries from raw logs.  
  Prompt engineering guided the LLM to produce structured, professional incident reports.

**AI Technologies Used:**  
- Llama2 (LLM, via Ollama)
- Python (for orchestration and API calls)
