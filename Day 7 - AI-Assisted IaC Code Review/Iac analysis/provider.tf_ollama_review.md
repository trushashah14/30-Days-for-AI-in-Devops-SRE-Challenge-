# Ollama LLM Review for ../../..\IT\AWS Architecture using Terraform\provider.tf

 This output shows the results of the Terraform code analysis performed by tfsec. It provides a summary of the number of passing, ignored, critical, high, medium, and low-level violations detected in the code. The exact meaning of each severity level is as follows:

* Passed: No issues were found with your infrastructure configuration. This indicates that your code meets the recommended best practices for security and compliance.
* Ignored: Some checks have been explicitly ignored by your Terraform code using comments or directives. These checks are not run, but their results are displayed in the report.
* Critical: High-level violations indicate security vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise your infrastructure. You should address these issues as soon as possible.
* High: Medium-level violations indicate potential security vulnerabilities or compliance risks that may not be critical, but still need to be addressed.
* Medium: Low-level violations indicate minor issues that do not pose significant security risks or compliance concerns. These issues can be safely ignored if you feel they are not a problem for your use case.
* Low: Very low-level violations indicate best practices that are not necessary for your infrastructure, but may help with maintainability and readability.

The output also includes information about the number of modules downloaded, processed, and files read during the analysis. This provides insight into the performance and resource usage of tfsec when analyzing large or complex Terraform configurations.
