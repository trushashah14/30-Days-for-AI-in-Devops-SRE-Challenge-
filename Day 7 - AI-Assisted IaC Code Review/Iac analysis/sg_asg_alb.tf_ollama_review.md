# Ollama LLM Review for ../../..\IT\AWS Architecture using Terraform\sg_asg_alb.tf

The output you're seeing is from the tfsec tool running in a terminal window. Here's what it means:

* "tfsec" is the name of the tool that you're using to scan your Terraform files for security vulnerabilities.
* The first line shows the version number of the tfsec tool and the command used to run it (in this case, "tfsec --format github").
* The following lines show the results of the scan, which include a summary of the number of checks that were performed, the number of potential problems detected, and the severity of those problems. In this case, you have 14 passed checks (i.e., no security vulnerabilities were detected) and 12 potential problem(s) detected, with the critical, high, medium, and low severities all being displayed separately.
* The "passed" line shows that 14 checks passed, which means that there were no security vulnerabilities detected in your Terraform files.
* The "potential problem(s)" line shows that 12 potential problems were detected, but they were all categorized as either critical, high, medium, or low severity issues.
* The "critical" line shows that 4 critical issues were detected, which means that your Terraform files have a relatively high level of security risk.
* The "high" line shows that 3 high issues were detected, which means that your Terraform files have a moderate level of security risk.
* The "medium" line shows that 1 medium issue was detected, which means that your Terraform files have a relatively low level of security risk.
* The "low" line shows that 4 low issues were detected, which means that your Terraform files have a relatively high level of security risk.
* Finally, the last line shows the total number of checks performed and the total time taken to scan your Terraform files (in this case, 20 checks in 36.4863ms).

Overall, this output indicates that tfsec has detected some potential security vulnerabilities in your Terraform files, but you can take steps to address these issues by implementing the recommended changes and running the scan again to confirm that they've been resolved.
