# Day 7: AI-Assisted IaC Code Review ü§ñ - Aug 14, 2025

## Challenge Description üéØ
Automatically review Terraform IaC files using tfsec (static analysis) and a local LLM (Ollama), then compare the outputs to highlight strengths and limitations of each approach.

## Objective üöÄ
- Find and analyze all Terraform `.tf` files
- Run tfsec for static security analysis
- Use Ollama LLM to review code for best practices, security, and improvements
- Save all outputs to markdown files in the `Iac analysis` folder
- Compare tfsec and LLM feedback for actionable insights

## Code & Implementation üíª
- **Notebook**: [`iac_code_review.ipynb`](./iac_code_review.ipynb)  
  Main workflow for finding, analyzing, and reviewing Terraform files using tfsec and Ollama LLM.
- **Step-by-Step Solution**: [`Step-by-Step-Solution.md`](./Step-by-Step-Solution.md)  
  Detailed explanation of each notebook step, including rationale and insights.
- **LLM & tfsec Outputs**:  
  - [`Iac analysis/`](./Iac%20analysis/) ‚Äì tfsec and Ollama review outputs for each Terraform file

## Workflow üîÑ
1. **Find Files:** Locate all `.tf` files in the workspace
2. **Static Analysis:** Run tfsec on each file's directory
3. **LLM Review:** Send code and tfsec output to Ollama for feedback
4. **Compare Outputs:** Print and compare tfsec and LLM results
5. **Temporary Limitation:** For testing, only `vpc.tf` is analyzed (can be extended later)
## Alternate LLMs
For more advanced analysis and richer feedback, commercial LLMs such as OpenAI's GPT models can be used via API keys. These may offer improved results but require paid access.
## Results & Insights üìà
- tfsec provides quick, automated security checks
- LLM review offers deeper, context-aware feedback and can catch issues missed by static tools
- Combining both approaches gives the best coverage for IaC code review

## What Did I Learn üß†
- **Static analysis** is fast and reliable for common misconfigurations
- **LLM review** is slower but more flexible and human-friendly
- **Prompt engineering** impacts the usefulness of LLM feedback
- **Automated markdown reporting** streamlines code review and sharing

## How to Use in Real-World DevOps/SRE üåç
### IaC Code Review Automation
**Use Case**: Automated security and best-practice review for Terraform code
- **Implementation**: Run tfsec and LLM review in CI/CD or pre-merge workflows
- **Advantage**: Reduces manual review time, uncovers deeper issues
- **Industry Example**: SRE teams reviewing infrastructure changes before deployment

### Combining Static & AI Review
**Use Case**: Comprehensive IaC quality assurance
- **Implementation**: Use both tools for maximum coverage
- **Advantage**: Fewer missed issues, more actionable feedback
- **Industry Example**: Enterprises with strict compliance and security requirements

## Where Was AI Used? ü§ñ

- **AI Used:**  
  Local LLM (Ollama, e.g. Llama2) was used to review Terraform IaC files for best practices and security improvements.  
  Static analysis (tfsec) was combined with LLM feedback for comprehensive code review.

**AI Technologies Used:**  
- Llama2 (LLM, via Ollama)
- tfsec (static analysis)
- Python (orchestration)

## Future Enhancements üöÄ
- Extend to all files and automate monthly runs
- Integrate with PR comments and CI/CD pipelines
- Add anomaly detection for infrastructure changes
- Use LLM to generate remediation playbooks
