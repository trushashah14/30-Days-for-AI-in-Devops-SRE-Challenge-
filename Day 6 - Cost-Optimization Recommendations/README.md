# Day 6: Cost-Optimization Recommendations üí∏ - Aug 13, 2025

## Challenge Description üéØ
Analyze last month's AWS billing data, identify high-cost services, and generate actionable cost optimization recommendations using local LLM (Ollama). No cloud API cost incurred.

## Objective üöÄ
- Load and analyze AWS billing CSV data
- Identify top cost-incurring AWS services
- Visualize service costs
- Use Ollama LLM to suggest rightsizing, savings plans, and cheaper alternatives
- Save recommendations to a markdown file

## Code & Implementation üíª
- **Notebook**: [cost_optimization.ipynb](./cost_optimization.ipynb)  
  Main workflow for loading, analyzing, visualizing AWS billing data, and generating cost optimization recommendations using Ollama LLM.
- **Sample Data**: [aws_billing.csv](./aws_billing.csv)  
  Example AWS billing export for testing and demonstration.
- **Step-by-Step Solution**: [Step-by-Step-Solution.md](./Step-by-Step-Solution.md)  
  Detailed explanation of each notebook step, including rationale and insights.
- **LLM Outputs**:  
  - [aws_cost_optimization_recommendations.md](./aws_cost_optimization_recommendations.md) ‚Äì Recommendations from the original prompt  
  - [aws_cost_optimization_recommendations_improved.md](./aws_cost_optimization_recommendations_improved.md) ‚Äì Recommendations from the improved prompt  
  Compare these files to evaluate the impact of prompt engineering on LLM-generated advice.
  

## Workflow üîÑ

1. **Load Data:** Import AWS billing CSV
2. **Summarize Costs:** Group and sort services by monthly cost
3. **Visualize:** Bar chart of service costs
4. **Select Top Services:** Identify top N cost-incurring services
5. **LLM Recommendations:** Use Ollama API to generate cost optimization actions and save to file

## Results & Insights üìà

- EC2, RDS, and Redshift are consistently top cost drivers
- Local LLM provides actionable recommendations (rightsizing, savings plans, alternatives)
- No cloud API cost; all processing is local

## What Did I Learn üß†
- **Direct sorting by cost** ensures the most expensive AWS services are always identified, avoiding the pitfalls of clustering approaches.
- **Clear visualization** (bar charts) makes it easy to spot optimization opportunities and communicate findings to stakeholders.
- **Local LLM automation** (Ollama) enables actionable, cost-saving recommendations without incurring cloud API costs.
- **Prompt engineering**: Comparing simple and detailed prompts demonstrates how prompt quality impacts the usefulness and specificity of LLM-generated advice.
- **Automated markdown reporting** streamlines monthly cost review, making it easier to track, share, and act on optimization insights.

## How to Use in Real-World DevOps/SRE üåç

### Cost Review & Optimization üí∏
**Use Case**: **Monthly AWS Bill Review**
- **Implementation**: Analyze billing CSV, visualize costs, and automate recommendations
- **Advantage**: Reduces manual review time and uncovers savings opportunities
- **Industry Example**: SaaS teams reviewing monthly AWS spend and acting on LLM suggestions
- **DevOps Integration**: Scheduled cost review and automated markdown report generation

### Rightsizing & Savings Plans üè∑Ô∏è
**Use Case**: **Resource Optimization**
- **Implementation**: Use LLM recommendations to rightsize EC2/RDS/Redshift and purchase savings plans
- **Advantage**: Direct cost reduction and improved resource utilization
- **Industry Example**: E-commerce platforms optimizing compute and database spend

### Cheaper Alternatives & Multi-Cloud üåê
**Use Case**: **Cost Comparison**
- **Implementation**: Evaluate open-source and multi-cloud alternatives for expensive AWS services
- **Advantage**: Further cost savings and vendor flexibility
- **Industry Example**: Startups migrating workloads to open-source or other cloud providers
