# Day 6: Cost-Optimization Recommendations ‚Äì Step-by-Step Solution üí∏

This document explains each step of the notebook, why it is needed, how it was implemented, and what insights were gained. It also discusses the choice of visualization and the difference between manual and automated cost review.

---

## Step 1: Introduction & Planning üìù

**Why:**  
Clarifies the goal: to optimize AWS costs using local analysis and LLM recommendations, with no cloud API cost.

**How:**  
A markdown cell outlines the workflow: load billing data, analyze, visualize, and automate recommendations.

**What did I get:**  
A clear roadmap for cost review and optimization.

---

## Step 2: Install Required Libraries üß©

**Why:**  
Pandas and matplotlib are needed for data analysis and visualization.

**How:**  
`!pip install pandas matplotlib --quiet`

**What did I get:**  
All necessary tools installed locally.

---

## Step 3: Import Libraries üìö

**Why:**  
To use pandas for data analysis and matplotlib for plotting.

**How:**  
Standard Python imports.

**What did I get:**  
Access to functions for cost analysis and visualization.

---

## Step 4: Load AWS Billing Data üïí

**Why:**  
AWS billing CSV provides detailed monthly spend by service.

**How:**  
Read CSV into pandas DataFrame.

**What did I get:**  
Structured data for analysis.

---

## Step 5: Summarize Costs by Service üëÄ

**Why:**  
Grouping and sorting by service cost highlights top spend areas.

**How:**  
Group by 'Service', sum 'Cost', sort descending.

**What did I get:**  
A ranked list of AWS services by monthly cost.

---

## Step 6: Visualize Service Costs üìä

**Why:**  
Bar chart makes it easy to spot expensive services.

**How:**  
Plot service costs using matplotlib.

**What did I get:**  
A clear visual of cost distribution.

---

## Step 7: Select Top Cost-Incurring Services and Generate LLM Recommendations Locally ü§ñ

**Why:**  
Focus optimization efforts on the biggest cost drivers and automate actionable cost-saving advice using Ollama LLM, with no cloud API cost.

**How:**  
- Select top N services by cost (where N is configurable in the notebook).
- Send both a simple and an improved prompt to Ollama API, save markdown outputs to files.
- Outputs are saved to `aws_cost_optimization_recommendations.md` (original) and `aws_cost_optimization_recommendations_improved.md` (improved).
- Review both files to compare clarity, depth, and usefulness.

**What did I get:**  
A shortlist for targeted recommendations and a practical demonstration of prompt engineering impact on LLM-generated cost optimization advice.
