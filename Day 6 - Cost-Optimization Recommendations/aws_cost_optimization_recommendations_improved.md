## AmazonEC2

* Monthly Spend: $1200.0

Rightsizing Recommendations:

* Use the appropriate instance type for your workload, rather than a more expensive instance type for unused features. For example, use t2 instances for general-purpose computing tasks instead of m5 instances with more CPU and memory than needed.
* Use spot instances or on-demand instances with low CPU utilization to reduce costs for idle instances.
* Consider using AWS Lambda or other serverless computing options for tasks that don't require a running instance.

Savings Plans/Reserved Instances:

* Use Reserved Instances to save up to 75% on the cost of running instances, which can be a more cost-effective option than spot instances in the long run.

Cheaper Alternatives:

* Consider using open-source alternatives like Apache Mesos or Kubernetes for container orchestration instead of Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS). These options are often free or low-cost and can provide similar functionality.
* Explore multi-cloud strategies that allow you to use resources from different cloud providers, rather than being locked into a single provider like AWS. This can help reduce costs by taking advantage of lower prices on other cloud platforms.

Implementation Steps:

1. Conduct an inventory of your current EC2 instances and identify any idle or underutilized resources.
2. Evaluate your workload requirements and choose the appropriate instance type for each task, based on the rightsizing recommendations above.
3. Consider using Reserved Instances or spot instances for running instances when possible.
4. Research and evaluate open-source alternatives like Apache Mesos or Kubernetes, and consider migrating any relevant workloads to these platforms.
5. Develop a multi-cloud strategy that allows you to take advantage of resources from other cloud providers as needed.

Estimated Savings: Depending on the specific actions taken, potential savings could be in the range of $200-500 per month.

Risks/Trade-offs:

* Migrating to open-source alternatives may require additional time and resources for setup and configuration.
* Using a multi-cloud strategy may introduce additional complexity and security risks, so it's important to carefully evaluate these trade-offs before implementing this approach.
