# Day 8: Synthetic Load Test Generation ‚Äì Step-by-Step Solution üö¶

This document explains each step of the notebook, why it is needed, how it was implemented, and what insights were gained. It also discusses the choice of visualization, the difference between real and synthetic request sequences, and why k6/Locust are used for load testing.

---

## Step 1: Introduction & Planning üìù
**Why:**  
Clarifies the goal: to generate synthetic load test sequences based on daily traffic patterns and use them for stress testing with k6 or Locust.

**How:**  
A markdown cell outlines the workflow: analyze logs, generate synthetic requests, run load tests, and visualize results.

**What did I get:**  
A clear roadmap for the notebook and project.

---

## Step 2: Install Required Libraries üß©
**Why:**  
pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and k6/Locust are needed for log analysis, ML modeling, visualization, and load testing.

**How:**  
`!pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib locust --quiet`  
Install k6 as per its documentation.

**What did I get:**  
All necessary tools installed locally.

---

## Step 3: Import Libraries üìö
**Why:**  
To use the installed packages for data processing, modeling, and plotting.

**How:**  
Standard Python imports for pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

**What did I get:**  
Access to functions for log analysis, ML modeling, and visualization.

---

## Step 4: Simulate or Load Log Data üïí
**Why:**  
Understanding real traffic patterns is essential for generating realistic synthetic sequences.

**How:**  
- Simulate hourly requests for multiple endpoints and methods.
- Aggregate requests by hour and endpoint.

**What did I get:**  
Insights into traffic distribution and peak load times.

---

## Step 5: Generate Synthetic Request Sequences ü§ñ
**Why:**  
ML models can learn traffic patterns and generate realistic synthetic sequences.

**How:**  
- Use probabilistic resampling (scikit-learn's resample) to mimic real traffic.
- Fit model to historical request patterns.

**What did I get:**  
Synthetic request data that mimics real traffic patterns.

---

## Step 6: Visualize Real vs Synthetic Request Patterns üëÄ
**Why:**  
To validate that synthetic data resembles real traffic.

**How:**  
Plot request counts over time for both real and synthetic data (line plot).

**Interpretation:**  
The synthetic traffic closely matches the real traffic pattern, with both showing peaks around midday and evening hours. This means your synthetic data generation is realistic and will produce meaningful load tests that reflect actual user behavior.

---

## Step 7: Prepare Synthetic Data for k6/Locust üõ†Ô∏è
**Why:**  
Synthetic requests must be formatted for load testing tools.

**How:**  
- Export synthetic sequences to JSON.
- Structure data as required by k6/Locust (endpoint, method, timestamp).

**What did I get:**  
Ready-to-use synthetic load files for stress testing.

---

## Step 8: Run Load Tests with k6/Locust üö¶
**Why:**  
To simulate realistic traffic and assess system performance under stress.

**How:**  
- Configure k6/Locust to read synthetic data.
- Execute load tests and monitor results.

**What did I get:**  
Performance metrics and insights into system scalability.

---

## Step 9: Visualize Load Test Results üìä
**Why:**  
Visualizations help interpret system behavior under synthetic load.

**How:**  
Plot response times, error rates, and throughput from k6/Locust results.

**Interpretation:**  
- **k6:**  
  - `/api/v1/user` requests are consistently slower than others, with durations rising above 90ms under load. `/api/v1/resource` and `/api/v1/item` are faster but also show increased latency as load grows.
  - `/api/v1/user` is the busiest endpoint, confirming its importance for scaling and reliability.
  - No errors occurred for any endpoint, showing the backend handled the synthetic load without failures.
  - POST requests to `/api/v1/user` and `/api/v1/resource` are the slowest, highlighting write operations as a bottleneck.
- **Locust:**  
  - `/api/v1/user` has the highest and most variable response times, indicating it is the slowest endpoint under load.
  - `/api/v1/user` receives the most requests per second, confirming it is the main traffic hotspot.
  - No errors were observed, so reliability is high even under synthetic stress.

---

## Step 10: Model Improvement ‚Äì Refine Synthetic Generation üèãÔ∏è
**Why:**  
Initial synthetic data may not capture all traffic nuances.

**How:**  
- Tune ML model parameters.
- Incorporate more features (e.g., endpoint popularity, burstiness).
- Regenerate and revalidate synthetic sequences.

**What did I get:**  
More accurate and challenging load tests.

---

## Step 11: Visualize and Compare Improved Load Test Results
**Why:**  
Assess impact of improved synthetic data.

**How:**  
- **k6 Comparison:** Faceted line plots, bar plots, error rate lines, heatmaps.
- **Locust Comparison:** Grouped bar charts for response time, throughput, error rate.

**Interpretation:**  
- Improved synthetic load causes higher response times for `/api/v1/user`, showing the system is more stressed and may need optimization.
- `/api/v1/user` remains the busiest endpoint, and improved synthetic data increases its share of traffic.
- No errors are seen in either run, confirming backend reliability.
- POST requests to `/api/v1/user` and `/api/v1/resource` are consistently the slowest, especially under improved synthetic load.

## Step 12: ck_api_server.py & mock_api_server.py ‚Äì Why Were They Created?
**Why:**  
`mock_api_server.py` was created to provide a backend API target for synthetic load tests. This allows k6 and Locust to send requests to realistic endpoints and measure actual system performance.

**How:**  
A simple Python Flask (or FastAPI) server was implemented in `mock_api_server.py` exposing endpoints such as `/api/v1/resource`, `/api/v1/item`, and `/api/v1/user`. These endpoints accept GET and POST requests and return mock responses, simulating real API behavior. This lets you safely run load tests without impacting production systems and ensures your synthetic requests hit actual endpoints for accurate performance measurement.

**What did I get:**  
A safe, controlled environment to run synthetic load tests and collect performance metrics for analysis.
