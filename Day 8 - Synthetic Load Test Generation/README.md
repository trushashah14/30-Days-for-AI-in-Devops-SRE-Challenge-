## Workflow üîÑ
1. **Simulate/Load Log Data:** Generate or import traffic logs for analysis.
2. **Analyze Traffic Patterns:** Visualize hourly cycles and endpoint popularity.
3. **Generate Synthetic Requests:** Use ML resampling to create realistic synthetic logs.
4. **Visualize Real vs Synthetic:** Line plot to validate synthetic data quality.
5. **Prepare Data for k6/Locust:** Export synthetic logs to JSON for load testing.
6. **Run Load Tests:** Use k6/Locust to replay synthetic requests and collect metrics.
7. **Visualize Results:** Use multiple graph types to interpret system performance.
8. **Model Improvement:** Refine synthetic generation for more challenging tests.
9. **Compare Results:** Grouped bar charts and faceted plots to compare baseline vs improved synthetic loads.

## Why Each Graph Was Chosen üìä

- **Line Plot (Real vs Synthetic Traffic):**  
  Clearly shows how well synthetic data matches real traffic cycles and peaks. Ideal for validating ML-generated data.

- **k6 Faceted Line Plot (Request Duration):**  
  Reveals latency trends for each endpoint over time. Useful for spotting bottlenecks and slow endpoints.

- **k6 Bar Plot (Throughput):**  
  Highlights which endpoints receive the most traffic. Makes it easy to compare endpoint load.

- **k6 Line Plot (Error Rate):**  
  Tracks errors per endpoint over time. Helps identify reliability issues and error spikes.

- **k6 Heatmap (Endpoint vs Method):**  
  Shows average latency for each endpoint-method pair. Useful for finding performance hotspots.

- **Locust Boxplot (Response Time):**  
  Displays spread and outliers in response times per endpoint. Best for understanding variability and consistency.

- **Locust Bar Chart (Throughput & Error Rate):**  
  Compares total requests and error rates per endpoint. Direct, readable comparison for prioritizing fixes.

- **Comparison Grouped Bar Charts (Locust & k6):**  
  Directly compare baseline and improved synthetic loads for response time, throughput, and error rate. Chosen for clear, side-by-side interpretation.

## Interpretation of Graphs üß†

- **Synthetic vs Real Traffic:**  
  Overlapping lines indicate synthetic data is realistic. Divergence means further tuning is needed.

- **k6 Visualizations:**  
  - Request duration spikes show bottlenecks.
  - High throughput bars highlight critical endpoints.
  - Error rate spikes indicate reliability issues.
  - Heatmap hotspots reveal slow endpoint-method pairs.

- **Locust Visualizations:**  
  - Wide boxplots mean variable performance.
  - High throughput bars show popular endpoints.
  - High error bars indicate endpoints needing reliability improvements.

- **Comparison Graphs:**  
  - Higher values for 'Improved' synthetic data mean the system is more stressed.
  - Differences between baseline and improved runs highlight bottlenecks and reliability limits.

## What Did I Learn üß©
- ML-generated synthetic data can closely mimic real traffic, making load tests more meaningful.
- k6 and Locust provide complementary metrics and visualizations for system analysis.
- Visualizing results with the right graph type makes bottlenecks and reliability issues easy to spot.
- Iterative improvement of synthetic data leads to more robust and realistic load testing.

## How to Use in Real-World DevOps/SRE üåç

### Synthetic Load Testing Automation
**Use Case:**  
Automatically validate API scalability and reliability before production releases.

**Implementation:**  
- Generate synthetic traffic logs using ML based on real production data.
- Export synthetic requests to JSON.
- Use k6 and Locust to replay these requests against a staging or mock API server.
- Analyze response times, error rates, and throughput using the notebook's visualizations.

**Advantage:**  
- Detect bottlenecks and slow endpoints before real users are impacted.
- Proactively tune backend performance and reliability.

**Industry Example:**  
A fintech SRE team uses ML-generated synthetic traffic to simulate peak trading hours, running k6 and Locust against their API in a staging environment. They identify slow POST endpoints and optimize database queries before the next release.

### Graph Selection for Interpretation
**Use Case:**  
Quickly pinpoint performance and reliability issues using targeted visualizations.

**Implementation:**  
- Use line plots to track hourly traffic and spot peak load periods.
- Use faceted line plots to compare latency trends for each endpoint.
- Use bar charts to identify which endpoints receive the most traffic.
- Use heatmaps to find slow endpoint-method pairs.
- Use boxplots to visualize response time variability and outliers.

**Advantage:**  
- Instantly see which endpoints or methods need attention.
- Make data-driven decisions for scaling and optimization.

**Industry Example:**  
A SaaS DevOps team reviews k6 and Locust graphs after each synthetic load test. They use heatmaps to spot slow POST requests and boxplots to monitor response time consistency, prioritizing fixes for endpoints with the widest spread or highest latency.
