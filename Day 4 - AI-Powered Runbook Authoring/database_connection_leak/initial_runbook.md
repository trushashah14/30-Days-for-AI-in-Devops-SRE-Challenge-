Introduction:
As a seasoned DevOps engineer with expertise in database administration, I have created this comprehensive runbook to guide you through the process of diagnosing and resolving database connection leaks in a production PostgreSQL environment. Connection leaks can lead to resource exhaustion and performance issues, so it is crucial to identify and fix them promptly. This runbook will cover symptoms, diagnostic commands, remediation procedures, verification steps, and preventative measures to help you address connection leaks in your PostgreSQL environment.

Step 1: Identifying Connection Leaks (Symptoms)
Common symptoms of connection leaks include:

* Slow queries or timeouts
* Increasing numbers of open connections
* Error messages related to connection limits

To confirm the presence of a connection leak, perform the following diagnostic commands:

1. Check the number of active connections:
```sql
SELECT gid, state FROM pg_stat_activity;
```
Expected output: The number of active connections should be within the configured limit (500 in this case). If the number of active connections exceeds the limit, it may indicate a connection leak.

Potential pitfalls: Be cautious when interpreting the output of `pg_stat_activity`. Make sure to check the `gid` and `state` columns carefully to identify any leaks.

Step 2: Diagnosing Connection Leaks (Diagnostic Commands)
To pinpoint the source of a connection leak, execute the following commands:

1. Check the PostgreSQL log files for error messages related to connection limits:
```sql
tail -n 10 /var/log/postgresql/pg_error_log
```
Expected output: Look for error messages indicating that too many connections are being established. This can help identify the location of the leak.
2. Check the PostgreSQL configuration file (`postgresql.conf`):
```sql
cat /etc/postgresql/13/postgresql.conf | grep connection
```
Expected output: Look for lines related to `max_connections`, `idle_in_transactions`, and `shared_buffers`. Check that these settings are configured correctly and match your observed behavior.

Potential pitfalls: Be careful when interpreting the log files, as errors can be caused by various factors. Make sure to check the PostgreSQL configuration file thoroughly to avoid overlooking any crucial settings.

Step 3: Resolving Connection Leaks (Remediation Procedures)
To fix a connection leak, follow these steps:

1. Restart the PostgreSQL server and all relevant services:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
sudo systemctl restart spring_boot
```
Expected output: The PostgreSQL server and Spring Boot services should be restarted successfully.
2. Modify the HikariCP connection pool settings to increase the maximum number of connections:
```diff
[hikari]
# ... other properties ...
max-connections = 500;
```
Expected output: The `max-connections` setting should be increased to match the observed behavior.
3. Check for any open connections and close them:
```sql
SELECT gid, state FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';
```
Expected output: Look for any active connections that should have been closed. If you find any, close them using `pg_terminate_backend()` or `psql -q -a`.
4. Verify the connection leak has been resolved (Verification Steps)
Perform the following verification steps to ensure the connection leak has been fixed:

1. Check the number of active connections again:
```sql
SELECT gid, state FROM pg_stat_activity;
```
Expected output: The number of active connections should now be within the configured limit. If it is not, repeat the remediation steps until the issue is resolved.
2. Monitor Prometheus and Grafana metrics for any signs of connection leaks:

a. Prometheus metrics to monitor: `pg_connections_created_total`, `pg_connections_created_per_second`, `pg_connections_active_total`, `pg_connections_active_per_second`.
b. Grafana dashboard to create: Create a dashboard that displays these metrics and sets alerts for any unusual patterns or spikes.

Potential pitfalls: Be cautious when verifying the resolution of a connection leak. Make sure to check all relevant metrics and dashboards to ensure the issue has been fully addressed.

Step 4: Preventing Future Connection Leaks (Preventative Measures)
To avoid future connection leaks, implement the following preventative measures:

1. Implement circuit breakers in your application code:

a. Use a library like Hystrix or Fallback to wrap database calls and introduce a delay for too many consecutive failures.
b. Set up failure tolerance thresholds to interrupt the call chain early if a connection leak is detected.
2. Monitor your application's resource usage:

a. Use monitoring tools like Prometheus or Datadog to track your application's CPU, memory, and database connection usage.
b. Set up alerts for any unusual patterns or spikes in resource usage that could indicate a connection leak.
3. Regularly review and adjust your PostgreSQL configuration:

a. Check the PostgreSQL documentation for recommended configuration settings.
b. Adjust the `max-connections` setting based on your observed behavior to prevent overloading the connection pool.
4. Implement a rolling update strategy for database updates:

a. Use a version control system like Git to keep track of changes in your database schema and code.
b. Implement a rolling update strategy that gradually deploys new versions of your application, allowing you to isolate issues before they affect the entire deployment.

Potential pitfalls: Be cautious when implementing preventative measures. Make sure to monitor resource usage and configuration changes carefully to avoid any unintended consequences.

Conclusion:
Diagnosing and resolving connection leaks in a production PostgreSQL environment requires a systematic approach. By following the steps outlined in this runbook, you can identify and fix connection leaks promptly, preventing performance issues and resource exhaustion. Remember to monitor your environment regularly, adjust configuration settings as needed, and implement preventative measures to avoid future connection leaks.
