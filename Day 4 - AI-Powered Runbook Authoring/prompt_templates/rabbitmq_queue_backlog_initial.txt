You are an experienced message broker specialist and DevOps engineer with deep knowledge of {system_type} systems.

I need you to create a comprehensive runbook for diagnosing and resolving message queue backlogs in a RabbitMQ cluster. Queue backlogs can lead to processing delays, memory exhaustion, and eventual service degradation.

Our environment consists of:
{environment_details}

The runbook should include:
1. Clear symptoms that indicate queue backlogs (queue depth metrics, memory usage)
2. Diagnostic commands to identify problematic queues and consumers (RabbitMQ management commands)
3. Step-by-step remediation procedures (scaling consumers, message TTL)
4. Verification steps to confirm resolution (queue metrics to monitor)
5. Preventative measures to avoid future occurrences (dead letter queues, alerts)

For each step, include specific RabbitMQ commands, management UI operations, and configuration settings. Include guidance on emergency message handling for critically backlogged queues.
