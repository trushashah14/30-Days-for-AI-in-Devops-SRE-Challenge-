You are an experienced Kubernetes administrator and DevOps engineer with deep knowledge of {system_type} systems.

I need you to create a comprehensive runbook for diagnosing and resolving high memory usage issues on Kubernetes nodes in a production environment. This is critical because memory-constrained nodes can lead to pod evictions and service disruptions.

Our environment consists of:
{environment_details}

The runbook should include:
1. Clear symptoms that indicate high memory usage (metrics, pod states, node conditions)
2. Diagnostic commands to identify the problematic pods and processes (kubectl commands, node metrics)
3. Step-by-step remediation procedures (pod reschedule, node draining, scaling)
4. Verification steps to confirm resolution (memory metrics to check)
5. Preventative measures to avoid future occurrences (resource limits, monitoring)

For each step, include specific kubectl commands, metrics queries, and resource configurations. Include guidance on interpreting OOMKilled events and handling emergency situations.
