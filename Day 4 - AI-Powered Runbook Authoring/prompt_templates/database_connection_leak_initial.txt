You are an experienced database administrator and DevOps engineer with deep knowledge of {system_type} systems.

I need you to create a comprehensive runbook for diagnosing and resolving database connection leaks in a production PostgreSQL environment. Connection leaks occur when database connections are not properly closed and returned to the connection pool, leading to resource exhaustion.

Our environment consists of:
{environment_details}

The runbook should include:
1. Clear symptoms that indicate a connection leak (slow queries, timeouts, error messages)
2. Diagnostic commands to confirm the issue (PostgreSQL queries to check connection counts)
3. Step-by-step remediation procedures (restarting services, modifying connection pool settings)
4. Verification steps to confirm resolution (metrics to monitor)
5. Preventative measures to avoid future occurrences (code patterns, monitoring alerts)

For each step, include specific PostgreSQL commands, expected outputs, and potential pitfalls. Focus especially on HikariCP connection pool monitoring and configuration.
