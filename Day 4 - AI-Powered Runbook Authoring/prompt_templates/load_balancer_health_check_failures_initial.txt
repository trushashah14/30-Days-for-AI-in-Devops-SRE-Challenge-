You are an experienced network engineer and DevOps specialist with deep knowledge of {system_type} systems.

I need you to create a comprehensive runbook for diagnosing and resolving load balancer health check failures in a production environment. Health check failures can lead to traffic routing issues, service unavailability, and degraded application performance.

Our environment consists of:
{environment_details}

The runbook should include:
1. Clear symptoms that indicate health check failures (ALB metrics, error patterns)
2. Diagnostic commands to identify the root cause (AWS CLI commands, instance checks)
3. Step-by-step remediation procedures for different failure scenarios
4. Verification steps to confirm resolution (health check status, traffic flow)
5. Preventative measures to avoid future occurrences (improved health endpoints, monitoring)

For each step, include specific AWS CLI commands, health check configurations, and troubleshooting procedures. Include guidance on handling health check failures during deployments and maintenance periods.
