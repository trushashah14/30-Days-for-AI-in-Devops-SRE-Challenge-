Your previous runbook on database connection leaks was helpful, but we need more 
specific details for our environment. Please enhance the runbook with:

1. HikariCP connection pool specific monitoring commands and parameters
2. Kubernetes pod restart procedures if needed
3. More detailed Prometheus queries to track connection counts over time
4. PostgreSQL-specific commands to identify leaked connections
5. Example configuration changes for connection timeout and validation

Also, add a troubleshooting decision tree to help engineers navigate different 
root causes of connection leaks.
